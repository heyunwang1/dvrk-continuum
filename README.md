# DaVinci-Assisted Continuum Robot Navigation and Manipulation
-----
# CISII_dvrk

## Description

This project aims to build a continuum robot navigation and manipulation system with a tendon-driven continuum robot end, based on the sawIntuitiveResearchKit repository available at https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit. The goal is to improve the reachability and dexterity of the DaVinci robot arm.
